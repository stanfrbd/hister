# Hister

**Your own search engine**

Hister is a general purpose web search engine providing automatic full-text indexing for visited websites.

## Features

- **Privacy-focused**: Keep your browsing history indexed locally - don't use remote search engines if it isn't necessary
- **Full-text indexing**: Search through the actual content of web pages you've visited
- **Advanced search capabilities**: Utilize a powerful [query language](https://hister.org/documentation/query-language/) for precise results
- **Efficient retrieval**: Use keyword aliases to quickly find content
- **Flexible content management**: Configure blacklist and priority rules for better control

## Setup & run

### Install the extension

Available for [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hister/cciilamhchpmbdnniabclekddabkifhb) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hister/)

### Download pre-built binary

- **Stable:** Grab a versioned binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/asciimoo/hister/releases).
- **Latest (HEAD):** Get the absolute latest build from our [Rolling Release](https://github.com/asciimoo/hister/releases/tag/rolling).

Choose the binary for your architecture (e.g., `hister_linux_amd64`), make it executable (`chmod +x hister_linux_amd64`), and run it.

Execute `./hister` to see all available commands.

### Build for yourself

**NPM is required**

- Clone the repository
- Build with `./manage.sh build` (or `go generate ./...; go build`)
- Run `./hister help` to list the available commands
- Execute `./hister listen` to start the web application

### Development

To work on the web app with hot reload and automatic Go rebuilds:

```
npm run serve:app
```

This starts a Vite dev server (with HMR) and the Go backend (with auto-rebuild via [air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)) concurrently.

### Use pre-built [Docker container](https://github.com/asciimoo/hister/pkgs/container/hister)

## Configuration

Settings can be configured in `~/.config/hister/config.yml` config file - don't forget to restart webapp after updating.

TUI-specific settings are stored in a separate `~/.config/hister/tui.yaml` file that is automatically created when you first run `hister search`.

Execute `./hister create-config config.yml` to generate a configuration file with the default configuration values.
